# SnakePictionary
A dumb idea me and my roommates had that I decided to do, because why not?

Imagine you're playing pictionary, but also snake. Like you're drawing with the snake.
See? I told you it'd be dumb.

Anyways:

Update 12/5/18: Initial commit.
  I'm kinda getting the snake thing down, but experiencing a weird glitch. I'll figure it out soon enough but yeah. This is a start.
